The tweaker.py is called by the jenkins when the accuracy of the program is less than that of desired accuracy.When called , it checks for the change in accuracy.
If the accuracy is more than the previous one , it further increases the value which it has previously increased.
If the accuracy is less than the previous way or if the accuracy did not exceed by a considerable amount , then this program revokes the previous changes done by it and moves to the next set of inputs to change.

The program works on a few assumptions : 

1)The accuracy increases on addition of layers.
2)When on adding a new convolve layer , if the accuracy did not increase as expected , then remove this new convolve layer , stop adding further convolve layers and 
    start adding fc layers.
3)The addition of fc layers should begin only after the addition of convolve layer finishes.
4)Each convolve layer should have the number of filters greater than or equal to double the number of layers in the previous layer.
5)Each convolve layer should have filter size greater than or equal to 2.
6)Each convolve layer shoul have pool size greater than or equal to 2.
7)The above 2 inputs pool size and filter size will be incremented by 1 at a time whereas number of filters in incremneted to double the previous value.
8)THe fc layer will be incremented by 100 from the previous one.
9)The number of filters initially  is 32.
10)The pool size and filter size initially are both 2.
11)The number of neurons initially is 100 when fc layer first taken.
12)The number of convolve layers initially is 1.
13)The number of fc layers initially is 0 excluding the output layer.
